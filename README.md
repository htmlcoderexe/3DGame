# 3DGame
3D game in ``MonoGame``

Doing this mostly from scratch, for my own entertainment, to better understand all the different processes that go on in complex games.

To be completed when I'm 70 and have a cane and a lawn to chase kids away from.

Outdated even before I started (yes, it used XNA when first created, a few years after XNA was declared dead).

Also, a lot of game-related stuff seems to be bits of arcane knowledge that nobody's willing to share. Well, guess what, I am willing. 

If you use any code from here, I pity you. Please do not try to locate my whereabouts for the purpose of prolonged torture followed by murder.

... hope it helps, though.

Some of these are taken at earlier stages, showing off various features the previous screenshot couldn't do justice for
